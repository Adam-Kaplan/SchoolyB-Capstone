###The What -
Welcome to The International Data Matrix (TIDM) Documentation. This started as a capstone project for my coding boot camp but I want to see it grow and see others use it.


###The When -
This project is still a work in progress. That being said nothing is finalized and all code is subject to change.


###The Why -
Being such a fan of history and geography. I thought it best to make this project not only to challenge myself but also give myself a reason to stay motivated throughout the process.

###The How -
This project is a SPA(single page application) was done in Vanilla JavaScript. Our boot camp <b><i>PROHIBITED</i></b> the use of certain softwares, frameworks, and libraries including but not limited to:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Or anything similar to the tools listed above

My understanding of the reasoning behind the decision to not allow use to use those particular tools is so that we(the students) focus on vanilla HTML/CSS & JavaScript so when the time comes to learn those new tools we are already ahead rather that starting completely from scratch. <b><i>SOME<i> </b>of the tools we are allowed to use for this project are as follows:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [The lit-html vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html)

***The above list will be updated as the course continues***
